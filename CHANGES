0.3

- Fixed bug where moving pointer over a new item didn't redraw the
  window.
- xitems is now pledge()d on OpenBSD.
- Removed the config.mk file: typing things like
  `make CFLAGS="-extra -flags"' now makes sense, and packaging should
  be easier.

0.2.1

Minor update: xitems now correctly redraws in the unlikely event of
xexepose (other than the first).

0.2

- Added support for UTF-8.
- Allocated resources are now freed on exit.

0.1

First release.
